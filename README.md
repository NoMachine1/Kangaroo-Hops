# 🦘 Kangaroo Hops: Simple Kangaroo Puzzle Solver 🧩  

**Warning:** This app makes kangaroos do math. No marsupials were harmed, just confused.

## 🚀 What Even Is This?  

Ever wanted to solve cryptographic puzzles **faster than a kangaroo on espresso**? Well, now you can!  

**Kangaroo Hops** is like *\"Where's Waldo?\"* but for private keys. Instead of a stripey-shirted dude, we hunt for crypto treasures using **a herd of mathematically gifted kangaroos**.  

---

## 🦘 How It Works (The \"Science\")  

1. **Release the Kangaroos** 🦘💨  
   - We drop `T` (Tame Kangaroos) and `W` (Wild Kangaroos) onto an elliptic curve.  
   - They hop around like they're at a rave. 🎉  

2. **The Great Hop** 🏃‍♂️💨  
   - Each kangaroo jumps (`Wi`) based on **secret kangaroo math** (don't ask).  
   - If they collide, **BAM!** Private key found.  

3. **Profit** 💰  
   - You get the private key.  
   - The kangaroos get virtual eucalyptus leaves. 🌿

## 🤔 Why Kangaroos?  

- **They're good at jumping** (just like our algorithm).  
- **They carry their babies in pouches** (just like we carry your crypto dreams).  
- **Nobody expects kangaroos to do math** (surprise!).
